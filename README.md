                            but with new filename with random strings
                            at last (before extension if present).

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, please make sure you have `shfmt` installed, and run
`make lint` before commiting. This ensures tabs and spaces does not get mixed,
as well as consistent styling.

Alternatively, you can use our provided hook to run `make lint` automatically
before git commits your changes.

To install the hook:
```bash
make install-hook
```

```bash
# For example, shfmt will ensure:
if condition
then
    do_stuff
else
    do_stuff
fi

# is always written as:
if condition; then
    do_stuff
else
    do_stuff
fi

# The same applies to loops and switch statements (case;esac)
```

### Abuse alert
Please don't abuse, we have limited storage.
Also I'm sharing my configs just for community use and I get nothing from it.

### Create Your Own
Just change your `rclone config` and `index link` in `ksau`.
